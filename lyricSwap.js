var testStr0 = `Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint in that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little back sun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

I turned those shutters the color of your eyes`;

var testStr1 = `White lies, but they're getting dark
Blurred lines, but they're getting clearer
Just tell the truth, ay, it's not that hard
You call me crazy
So am I crazy?
Your words don't hold any weight
I can't seem to get a straight answer
Don't trust you, but who's to blame?
I think you're crazy
But am I crazy?

Got me second guessin' everything you say
Thinkin' that I know you, but you're really a stranger
Doin' what you gotta do to get your way
You're reckless and selfish and you can't help it

Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But you're lyin' to me constantly, oh
All the bullshit, I don't need it
And honestly, I don't believe it, nah
Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But I don't want your dumb apology, no`;
